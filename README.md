Distributed Databases Project

The project aims to design and implement a Distributed Social Media Platform that leverages 
distributed database concepts for scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient data management. The 
platform will include user profiles, posts, comments, and other social interactions. This project 
is justified by the increasing demand for robust and scalable social media systems that can handle 
a large user base and ensure reliable performance.
Tasks:
▪  Schema design for user profiles, posts, comments, and friendships.
▪  We choose PostresSQL for relational database system activities.
▪  Data distribution plan based on






























Plan of Action


























Part 1: Design and Implementation of a Distributed Database System









Part 2: Fragmentation and Replication Techniques


























user locations or interests.
▪  Efficient data insertion mechanism for real-time updates.

Expected Deliverables:
▪  Distributed Database Schema
▪  Database Tables Creation Scripts
▪  Data Distribution Plan Documentation
▪  Data Insertion Mechanism Code
Tasks:
▪  Horizontal fragmentation for distributing user data based on regions.




▪  Vertical fragmentation for optimizing data retrieval based on specific user 
attributes.
▪  Replication strategies for fault tolerance.





















Part 3: Query Processing and Optimization Techniques









Part 4: Distributed Transaction Management










Part 5: Distributed NoSQL Database Systems Implementation










Expected Deliverables:
▪  Fragmentation and Replication Code/Scripts
▪  Snapshots Demonstrating Fragmentation and Replication
Tasks:
▪  Query optimization for efficient retrieval of posts, comments, and friend lists.
▪  Distributed indexing strategies to improve query performance.
Expected Deliverables:
▪  Query Optimization Code/Scripts
▪  Distributed Indexing Implementation
Tasks:
▪  ACID-compliant distributed transactions for critical social interactions.
▪  Concurrency control mechanisms for simultaneous transactions.

Expected Deliverables:
▪  Distributed Transaction Management Code/Scripts
▪  Documentation on ACID Compliance
Tasks:
▪  We choose MongoDB for NoSQL related activities.
▪  Define and document the data schema tailored to social media data needs.
▪  Implement basic CRUD operations for storing and retrieving social interactions.

Expected Deliverables:
▪  NoSQL Database Implementation Code/Scripts
▪  Data Schema and Model Documentation
