Distributed Databases Project


The project aims to design and implement a Distributed Social Media Platform that leverages distributed database concepts for scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient data management. The platform will include user profiles, posts, comments, and other social interactions. This project is justified by the increasing demand for robust and scalable social media systems that can handle a large user base and ensure reliable performance.
